    This method is the main end-point of the evil third-party. Whenever a
    request is made for the embedable content of the evil third-party, it will
    go through this function.

    The first time a request is made to the evil third-party, the evil
    third-party will set a cookie with a unique random ID to identify the user's
    session.

    Thereafter, whenever a request is made to this evil third-party, it will
    save a tuple of the user's (cookie-id, URL) to track the user's history on
    the first-party site.

    In order to show the "Gotcha" message to W, we check if the URL matches the
    URL form submission scheme and change the response to a different document
    saying "Gotcha W, your name is _____"

    In any other case, this evil third-party will show a random advertisement to
    seem like the service isn't tracking the users
